\f0\fs24 \cf0 This code written by Lin Bo performs distributed calculator in C++ .\
\
To compile simply run \'93make\'94. \
Two executable files, \'93server\'94 and \'93client\'94 will be generated.\
\
To make a connection:\
1)run \'93./server\'94+ port number\
2)run \'94./client\'94 + hostname + port number\
\
To perform calculation:\
The client will prompt you to enter an operator followed by two operands (single space separated):\
[PLUS|MINUS|TIMES|DIVIDE] operand1 operand2\
(e.g. \'93PLUS 1 3\'94)\
Each operand should be a number in the range [0,65535].\
After calculation made by server, the client will print the answer prefixed by \'93RESULT\'94\
 (e.g. \'93RESULT 4\'94)\
Enter 'OK CLOSE' to exit.\
\
To test:\
Several test cases have been provided in \'93test_in.txt\'94.\
Simply uncomment the test section (marked by /*--for test--*/ and /*--for test end\'97*/) in client.cpp to test.\
The output file is \'93test_out.txt\'94.\
